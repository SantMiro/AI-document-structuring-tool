# AI-document-structuring-tool
This repository contains all the files needed for the deployment of the AI Document Structuring and Clustering Tool.

# Project Breakdown
## Core Features and Workflow
### 1. Document Structuring:

#### Objective: Automatically identify and structure key sections within unstructured documents (e.g., research papers, reports, legal docs).

#### Steps:
* Section Detection: Use NLP techniques to identify common sections (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Conclusion, etc.). Start with rule-based approaches (e.g., searching for common section headings) and evolve toward machine learning models that detect context.
* Table of Contents Generation: After identifying sections, automatically generate a dynamic table of contents that links to each section within the document.
* Section Summaries: Use a summarization model to create a brief summary of each section. This could help users get an overview without reading the entire document.

### 2. Document Clustering:

#### Objective: Group related documents into clusters based on similar themes or topics.

#### Steps:
* Feature Extraction: Use embeddings to convert documents into vector representations capturing their semantic meaning.
* Clustering Algorithm: Implement clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering to group similar documents together.
* Visual Representation: Use a tool like t-SNE or UMAP to visualize clusters, offering users an intuitive view of their document set.

### 3. Search within Clusters:

#### Objective: Allow users to search within clusters for specific terms, concepts, or themes across multiple documents.

#### Steps:
* Text Search Engine: Integrate a text search engine like Elasticsearch or Whoosh to index the clustered documents.
* Search Optimization: Use semantic search techniques to rank documents based on their relevance to the query (e.g., via embeddings rather than simple keyword matching).

## Phase-Wise Development
### Phase 1: Document Structuring
* Input and Parsing: Implement file upload support for various document formats (PDFs, Word docs, etc.). Extract and parse the text.
* Section Detection: Develop rules or use pre-trained models to detect document sections.
* Dynamic Table of Contents: Create a dynamic TOC that links to the identified sections in the document.
* Section Summaries: Apply summarization techniques to each section for a high-level overview.

### Phase 2: Document Clustering
* Vectorization: Convert documents into vector embeddings using models like BERT or SBERT.
* Clustering Algorithm: Implement a clustering algorithm (starting with something simple like K-means).
* Cluster Visualization: Visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP.

### Phase 3: Search within Clusters
* Indexing: Build a search index for the clustered documents using tools like Elasticsearch.
* Semantic Search: Integrate semantic search using embeddings to improve search accuracy beyond simple keyword matching.

## Tech Stack Backend:

* Python (FastAPI/Flask): For building the core functionalities (e.g., document parsing, section detection, summarization).
* NLP Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers (for embeddings, summarization), NLTK/spaCy (for text processing).

## Tech Stack Frontend:

* React or Vue.js: For building the interactive user interface where users upload documents, view structured content, and explore clusters.
* Database/Search Engine:

    * Elasticsearch: For search and indexing.
    * PostgreSQL/MySQL: For storing document metadata, user information, and other persistent data.

## Visualization:

* Plotly or D3.js: For visualizing document clusters.
